"""The CP-SAT calls the generators and uniqueness proofs here all make.

Every proof in this repo has one shape: solve, read the assignment back,
forbid it, solve again. `forbid` posts that clause, `has_second_solution`
posts it and solves, `solve_unique` runs the whole shape, `solver` is the
configuration they run under, and `sudoku_model` is the standard board they
run it on.

The configuration is the part worth stating once, because a solver is asked
for two different things:

- **A committed proof** takes `solver(limit)` -- one worker, seed 0,
  reproducible run to run. CP-SAT's parallel portfolio races its workers, so
  which solution comes back depends on thread timing, and a `regenerate +
  git diff` gate over a portfolio search compares noise. One worker is slower,
  and that is the price of a verdict that means the same thing twice.
- **A search for a fresh grid** takes `solver(limit, reproducible=False,
  seed=..., randomize=True)` -- the full portfolio, the caller's seed. Nothing
  downstream re-derives that grid; it is written to a gen JSON and proved from
  there.

One proof takes the portfolio anyway: isofill's full-board check, whose 10x10
model a single worker cannot finish inside any usable limit. Its README
carries the measurement and the argument.
