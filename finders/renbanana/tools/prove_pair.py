"""Prove or refute: can any Renbanana grid hold two circled 2x2/2x3 rectangles?

Everything so far has been per-grid. 30,140 sampled grids came back INFEASIBLE
and 826 of the 3,308 pair geometries admit no digits at all, but a sample of
grids cannot say the pair is impossible -- only that we did not find one.

This asks the question once per geometry, over *all* grids and *all* shadings
at the same time. The pipeline has never done a joint search (renbanana_cpsat's
docstring says so outright: "never a joint shading+digit search"), because the
free version is enormous. Pinning a geometry is what makes it tractable: ten to
twelve cells are chocolate before the solver starts, their twenty-odd border
cells are banana, and the whisper inside both rectangles is fixed.

Only the 2,482 geometries a sudoku can carry are worth asking. The other 826
are already proved impossible at the digit level, and a superset of an
impossible constraint set is impossible.

What is exact here and what is lazy:

- Chocolate groups are rectangles: exact, via stage 1's lemma -- connected plus
  no 2x2 window holding exactly three of a colour means every group is a
  rectangle. So rule 3 alone carries it.
- Banana size cap: exact, structurally, on component labels.
- Whisper: exact -- two adjacent chocolate cells differ by 5 or more.
- Renban: exact, and this is the expensive half. Per label, the member digits
  are distinct and span a run: max - min == size - 1. It cannot be lazy the way
  rule 4 is, because a component shape that is illegal with one set of digits
  is legal with another, so a shape-level cut would be unsound.
- Banana non-rectangle: lazy, exactly as stage 1 does it. A rectangular banana
  group is illegal whatever its digits, so forbidding that one pattern is
  sound forever.

An INFEASIBLE is therefore a proof for that geometry.
