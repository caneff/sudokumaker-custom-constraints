"""Soundness suite for the counting shaded finder.

    uv run pytest finders/counting_shaded

Covers the places this hunt actually went wrong: a filter that disagreed
between C and Python, a hand-rolled solution counter with no independent
check, and a CP-SAT encoding that reported infeasible for the wrong reason.
Every claim here is falsifiable against a second implementation — the C
against Python, the bitmask counter against CP-SAT, one shape model against
the other — and every "nothing found" claim is paired with a positive control,
so a filter that rejects everything fails the suite instead of passing it.
