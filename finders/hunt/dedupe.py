"""Canonical dedupe key under a finder's declared symmetry group (#483/#484).

`key(candidate)` (part of the finder contract) returns a flat tuple of cell
values, in whatever fixed order the finder chooses. A cell map is a tuple of
source indices the same length as that grid: `transformed[i] = grid[map[i]]`.
`D4` is generated from the grid's own side length (the grid must be square);
`IDENTITY` is the one-element group that changes nothing; a custom group is
any list of such maps, for a rule whose symmetry is not the whole square.

`canonical_key` is the least of the grid's images under the group -- equal
keys mean the same candidate up to that symmetry.
