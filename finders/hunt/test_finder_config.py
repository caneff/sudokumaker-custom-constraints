"""A finder's own config and an empty seed's reason, black-box on the `hunt`
CLI (#491, forced by the qqrr pilot finder).

A real finder has knobs of its own -- which board, which corner, how long a
solve may take -- that the driver's argv does not name. The finder hands them
to the driver as `finder.config`; run.json records it, and a resume under a
different config refuses rather than mixing two searches in one directory.
A seed that finds nothing can say why (`protocol.Empty`), so a solver's
timeout and its proof of infeasibility stay apart in progress.jsonl.
