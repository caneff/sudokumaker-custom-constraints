"""Hunt resume after a kill, black-box on the `hunt` CLI (#487).

Runs the toy finders in this directory as subprocesses and checks only what
a caller of the hunt CLI can see: exit code, stderr, and the output files --
never an internal of driver.py, except the one test that drives
`driver.run()` directly in-process to pin an exact thread interleaving (see
its own comment for why). Kinds of interruption exercised:

- A genuine `SIGKILL` mid-hunt, via a finder that sleeps a few ms per seed so
  the kill reliably lands before the range completes (no timing race).
- A hand-corrupted trailing line, for the one case a real kill can leave
  that a timing race can't reliably reproduce: a write caught mid-syscall.
- A hand-truncated last progress.jsonl line, simulating a kill between an
  example's append to examples.jsonl and that seed's own progress event --
  the orphan-example case (#487, added scope from the Codex pass on #507).
- A hand-rolled-back state.json, simulating a kill between a seed's
  progress.jsonl event and its state.json save (#812 Codex pass 1).
- A precisely-timed thread barrier reproducing the fresh-vs-resume
  classify-before-lock race a real kill/schedule-delay combination can
  trigger but can't reliably reproduce on demand (#812 Codex pass 1).
