"""The dedupe key holds up under each symmetry group (#484).

Independent of dedupe.py's own transform code: this test rotates and flips
a 4x4 shape by hand (plain nested-list index arithmetic) and checks
canonical_key agrees across all eight images under D4, disagrees under
IDENTITY, and follows a hand-picked custom group instead of the full D4 one.
