"""The hunt driver: `run(finder, argv)` (#483/#484/#487).

A thin loop over a finder's `propose`/`verify`/`record`/`key`: it owns the
output directory, inline verification, dedupe and resume after a kill -- no
finder rule, no search strategy. A fresh `--out` (no `run.json`) starts a
new hunt; an `--out` that already has one resumes it: seeds with a
`seed_done` event are skipped, the dedupe set is rebuilt from the durable
log, and a finder's optional `save_state`/`load_state` round-trip through
state.json. A differing argv versus the recorded run refuses to start; a
differing git sha only warns. The grid helpers, CP-SAT helpers, the
`--workers`/load gate, deferred verification and the render hook are the
other later tickets (#485-#490) under the parent spec (#483).

    uv run finders/hunt/toy_finder.py --out DIR --seeds START:END

Every accepted example carries a driver-owned `__dedupe_key__` field
alongside whatever `finder.record()` returned, so the dedupe set can be
rebuilt from examples.jsonl on resume the way the ticket asks -- the
double-underscore name is meant to never collide with a finder's own
field. progress.jsonl's per-seed `outcome` (empty/rejected/duplicate/
example) is what lets summary.json's counts rebuild without trusting a
summary.json snapshot a kill may have left stale.

`_process_seed` writes, in order: the example (if any) to examples.jsonl,
that seed's event to progress.jsonl, then (`_hunt_loop`) the finder's saved
state to state.json. A kill can catch any prefix of that sequence, leaving
progress.jsonl's tail ahead of either or both of the other two logs --
`_reconcile` trims progress.jsonl's tail, seed by seed, until it's not
ahead of anything, before resume rebuilds anything from the logs.
