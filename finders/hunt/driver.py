"""The hunt driver: `run(finder, argv)` (#483/#484/#487).

A thin loop over a finder's `propose`/`verify`/`record`/`key`: it owns the
output directory, inline verification, dedupe and resume after a kill -- no
finder rule, no search strategy. A fresh `--out` (no `run.json`) starts a
new hunt; an `--out` that already has one resumes it: seeds with a
`seed_done` event are skipped, the dedupe set is rebuilt from the durable
log, and a finder's optional `save_state`/`load_state` round-trip through
state.json. A differing argv versus the recorded run refuses to start; a
differing git sha only warns. `--no-verify` skips `finder.verify` while
searching, and `hunt verify DIR` (#489) runs it afterwards over everything
`--no-verify` saved, writing one verdict per examples.jsonl line to
verified.jsonl. A finder's optional `render` (#490) gets a picture saved to
renders/<seed>.png right after that seed's example is accepted; a finder
with no `render` gets no renders/ directory at all. `--workers` (default 3,
set on the finder before the first seed) and the 1-minute load gate
(refuses above 24 unless `--force-load`) are #488. This is the last ticket
under the parent spec (#483) -- an unresumed killed hunt's renders/ can
still hold a seed with no matching examples.jsonl line (#522), tracked
separately.

    uv run finders/hunt/toy_finder.py --out DIR --seeds START:END
    uv run finders/hunt/toy_finder.py --out DIR --seeds START:END --no-verify
    uv run finders/hunt/toy_finder.py verify DIR

Every accepted example carries a driver-owned `__dedupe_key__` field
alongside whatever `finder.record()` returned, so the dedupe set can be
rebuilt from examples.jsonl on resume the way the ticket asks -- the
double-underscore name is meant to never collide with a finder's own
field. progress.jsonl's per-seed `outcome` (empty/rejected/duplicate/
example) is what lets summary.json's counts rebuild without trusting a
summary.json snapshot a kill may have left stale.

`_process_seed` writes, in order: the example (if any) to examples.jsonl,
that seed's event to progress.jsonl, then (`_hunt_loop`) the finder's saved
state to state.json. A kill can catch any prefix of that sequence, leaving
progress.jsonl's tail ahead of either or both of the other two logs --
`_reconcile` trims progress.jsonl's tail, seed by seed, until it's not
ahead of anything, before resume rebuilds anything from the logs.

    finder's key shape, before `_resume` writes anything -- two checks,
    both run ahead of any write (#525; `_repair_renders`, #524, moved
    ahead of the same check on rebase):

    1. The group against the key length already durable in
       examples.jsonl, with no finder call at all -- catches a resume
       whose entire seed range is already done, where check 2 below never
       has an un-done seed to probe and so would otherwise never notice a
       stale recorded shape (Codex pass 1 on PR 530, finding 1).
    2. The first not-yet-done seed's *actual* key -- for a finder whose
       `key()` shape changed since the run being resumed last succeeded,
       where the group's own length still happens to match the *old*
       recorded shape and check 1 can't see the drift without a real
       candidate (#525 review C2/P1's own regression test depends on
       this).

    `symmetry in (D4, IDENTITY)` skips both: D4's own "needs a square
    grid" ValueError is a separate, out-of-scope bug (#509 review C3),
    never converted to `SymmetryMismatch` either way, so neither check
    can ever produce a refusal on that path -- running them anyway would
    only spend an unconditional extra propose/verify per resume for
    nothing (#525 review C4, #529).

    `done_seeds` must be the reconciled set `_hunt_loop` will actually
    skip, not a raw read of progress.jsonl (#525 review C2/P1). Calling
    `finder.propose`/`verify` again for check 2 is only safe for a
    stateless finder; a stateful one's `save_state`/`load_state`
    round-trips the in-memory state around the probe so it can't
    double-count whatever the probed seed did (#525 review C1) --
    `_resume` must call `_load_state` before this runs, so the snapshot
    taken here is the resumed state, not the finder's fresh default. That
    snapshot is a deep copy (`json.loads(json.dumps(...))`), not the live
    object `save_state()` returned -- a finder that mutates its own saved
    state in place (rather than returning a fresh one each call) would
    otherwise see the probe's mutation bleed into the "restored" state
    too, since restoring a reference restores nothing (Codex pass 1 on
    PR 530, finding 2).
