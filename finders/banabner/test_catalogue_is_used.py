"""The Banabner model reads the difference-4 rectangle catalogue at both call
sites (#761), as `finders/renbanana/tools/test_catalogue_is_used.py` checks
for Renbanana.

    uv run finders/banabner/test_catalogue_is_used.py

Each check pins the known grid and poisons one half of the catalogue: a call
site that reads it turns the pinned grid INFEASIBLE, one that dropped it
leaves the grid FEASIBLE and fails the check. The known grid's 2x2 at r5c3 is
the rectangle poisoned.
