"""Possible shaded cell grids: connected all-visible configurations, uniqueness aside.

    uv run finders/shaded/census.py --seconds 600 --out DIR

A configuration here is a (grid, shape) pair where the grid is a valid sudoku,
the shape is an orthogonally connected set of shaded cells, and every shaded cell's
digit equals its shaded-neighbour count. Nothing about uniqueness -- this is the
population the uniqueness hunt draws from, and the baseline corpus for
validating anything that claims to handle connected shaded cells.

One solve per configuration with a fresh random objective, which is what keeps
consecutive answers apart (solve-then-forbid returns near-identical shapes).
Every hit is re-verified from the stored grid and shape before it is written,
by code that does not share the model: the grid is checked as a sudoku, the
shape as connected by flood fill, and each shaded cell digit against its own count.
