"""Shaded, connected: search the shape inside a fixed solved grid. BROKEN SAMPLER.

    uv run finders/shaded/gridfirst.py --seconds 300 --min-shaded 20

DO NOT TRUST THIS FILE'S NUMBERS. `random_grid()` below builds grids by
relabelling, moving rows within bands, swapping bands and stacks and
transposing one BASE grid. Those are exactly the sudoku-preserving symmetries,
so every grid it returns is isomorphic to BASE -- it samples one equivalence
class out of 5.47 billion, not the space. The shaded-count constraint is not
invariant under those symmetries, so results vary just enough to look like
sampling.

It is kept as a recorded dead end. Its reported ceiling of 9 shaded cells over 38,064
"random" grids is an artefact; `joint.py --maximize` proves the true ceiling is
26, confirmed by a second encoding in `recheck_ceiling.py`. Full account:
`docs/research/2026-09-16-shaded-connected-decision-log.md`, entries 3 and 4.
Use `joint.py` or `census.py`, which hold the grid as a variable instead.

The shape-only model (connected.py) keeps returning connected shapes whose
givens no sudoku grid completes -- admissible but 0 solutions. This flips it:
fix a solved grid first, then a shaded cell set S only has to satisfy

    grid[i] == |NEIGH[i] & S|   for every i in S

with S orthogonally connected. Admissibility is then free (the grid is a valid
sudoku, so two shaded cells in a house cannot show the same digit), and every hit is
solvable by construction -- the grid is a witness. Uniqueness is the only thing
left to check, with the bounded counter.

Grids come from a base grid under relabelling, within-band row moves, band and
stack swaps and transposition, which is cheap and diverse enough to prototype.
