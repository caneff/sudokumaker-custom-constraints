"""The U-Bahn model against an exhaustive enumeration, on a 4x4 board with
exactly 2 crosses in r2 (#773).

A cross cannot sit on the border, so the two crosses are r2c2 and r2c3: their
7 edges are on and the other 17 are free, 131,072 edge assignments. `brute`
walks every one with the solver-free rules in `network.py`; the CP-SAT model
must return the same networks under both connectivity encodings, and the
finder's uniqueness verdict must match the count of networks that share a
full set of outside numbers.

A second space, 3x4 with no blank in r2, covers what the first cannot: a
condition on blank cells, and edge sets with no dead end that are not
connected.
