"""Time the PySAT uniqueness check against the CP-SAT one on the 15 fixture
puzzles (#776). Run by hand; no gate runs it.

    uv run finders/ubahn/time_sat.py [--reps N] [--time-limit SECONDS]
    uv run finders/ubahn/time_sat.py --fillings CAP

Prints a Markdown table: per puzzle, each check's verdict and its fastest of
N runs in milliseconds, model build included, one core. A run the time limit
stopped prints as "timeout" and its time is the cap, not a solve time; its
row agrees with nothing and the script exits 1.

`--fillings CAP` prints instead how many fillings each puzzle's numbers have
before connectivity is asked for, counted up to CAP.
