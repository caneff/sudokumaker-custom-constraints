"""The CP-SAT model of a U-Bahn network (#773).

One boolean per edge is the decision; everything else is channelled from the
edges. Per cell, one table over its arms lists the 12 legal arm patterns and
the piece each one makes (blank for no arm), so a dead end has no row. The
pieces and blank cells of a row or column sum to its outside numbers. Connectivity has two encodings: `flow`
(single-commodity flow, what the finder searches with) and `tree` (a spanning
tree with level labels, the independent check). Both hang off the same root,
the first used cell in reading order.

Flows and trees are not unique per network, so the model has many solutions
for one network: count networks by solve, forbid on the edge variables,
re-solve (`uniqueness`), never by `enumerate_all_solutions`.
