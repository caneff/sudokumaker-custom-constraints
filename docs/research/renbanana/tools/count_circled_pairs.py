"""How many ways can a circled 2x2 and a circled 2x3 coexist in one grid?

The pool has 78 verified grids in about 18 shading families and not one holds
two chocolate rectangles that both carry a circle. That could mean the
geometry is scarce, or that the digits refuse. This separates the two.

Layer B -- each rectangle judged against the #377 catalogue alone -- says the
geometry is not scarce: 28 of 64 placements of a 2x2 can carry a circle, 38 of
56 of a 2x3 (and of a 3x2), and after dropping pairs that overlap or touch,
1360 geometries survive. Touching is out because each rectangle has to be a
*maximal* chocolate group, so a shared border cell would be chocolate in one
and banana in the other.

Layer B judges the two rectangles independently, which is the gap this closes.
Two rectangles sharing a box, a row, or a column constrain each other, and a
circle demands a specific digit in each: 4 somewhere in the 2x2, 6 somewhere in
the 2x3. So for every surviving geometry this asks CP-SAT for a full solved
sudoku in which both rectangles are internally whisper-legal (every orthogonal
pair inside a chocolate rectangle differs by at least 5) and both circles land.

An INFEASIBLE here is a proof about the pair, and it is a proof no amount of
walking would have found.
