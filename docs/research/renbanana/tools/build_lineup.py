"""Rebuild lineup.html from the candidate pools: DATA spliced into lineup_template.html.

    uv run python docs/research/renbanana/tools/build_lineup.py

Every `cand_*.json` under a pool directory becomes one card. A pool's name is
the run label on the card, so a new hunt only needs a line in POOLS.

**Looking at the page you just built.** A change here is judged from a picture,
and Orca's own browser renders it — no web server, no headless Chrome. The
commands are top-level, not under an `orca browser` group, which is what makes
them easy to miss in a truncated `--help`:

    orca-ide tab create --url file://wsl.localhost/Ubuntu-24.04/$PWD/lineup.html
    orca-ide tab list --json            # check `loadError` is null
    orca-ide screenshot --format png --json | ...   # base64 in .result.data

Three things that cost half an hour the first time:

* **The URL must be the UNC form.** Orca is the Windows build and WSL is only
  the shell, so `file:///home/caneff/...` returns `ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` while
  `file://wsl.localhost/Ubuntu-24.04/home/caneff/...` loads. `tab list --json`
  reports the failure in `loadError`; the tab itself looks fine.
* **`screenshot` shoots the active tab.** Passing `--page <id>` to it answered
  `runtime_unavailable`; `orca-ide tab switch --page <id>` first, then shoot.
* **The page's own controls are off by default**, so a shot of the plain page
  proves nothing about a toggle. Drive them with `orca-ide eval`, which wants
  an *expression* — wrap the statements in an IIFE, and reach the elements
  through `document.getElementById`, since a bare `sort` is not a global:

    orca-ide eval --expression "(()=>{const s=document.getElementById('sort');
      s.value='houseCircles';s.dispatchEvent(new Event('input'));
      const h=document.getElementById('house');h.checked=true;
      h.dispatchEvent(new Event('input'));return s.value})()"

The page is theme-aware and Orca usually runs dark, so check both: the tokens
are defined on bare `:root` and re-defined under `prefers-color-scheme: dark`.
