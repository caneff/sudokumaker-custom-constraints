"""Does grid shadeability cluster, or is every legal grid isolated?

Random solved grids are effectively never shadeable, so sampling them is not a
generator. The rescue would be local search: start from a grid we know works
and walk. That only pays if a *neighbour* of a shadeable grid is often
shadeable too. This measures exactly that.

A move is one of the sudoku symmetries that actually changes the whisper
structure -- swapping two rows inside a band, two columns inside a stack, or
relabelling two digits. (Transposing and the 10-v relabel are excluded: both
preserve every |difference|, so they map a legal grid to a legal one for free
and would only flatter the result.)
