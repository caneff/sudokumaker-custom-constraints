# Renbanana — the chocolate rectangle catalogue

Ticket #377. Every legal chocolate rectangle, enumerated exhaustively, in two
layers. The circle-value table in `CIRCLE-VALUES.md` (#374) falls out of this
as a query; the support matrices here are the reusable part.

Data: `rectangle-catalogue.json` beside this file — per shape, per box offset,
the count, the support matrix, one example filling, and the circle cells.

**A shape being in this catalogue means it is *locally* legal. It does not mean
it fits in a real grid.** The catalogue says nothing about whether a legal
shading can put that rectangle there, nor about the digits outside it. 1x8 is
the standing counterexample: it is catalogue-legal (2 fillings) and yet
UNSAT in a real grid, because it dies at the shading stage.

## What is enumerated

A filling of an `a x b` rectangle is legal when:

- orthogonally adjacent cells differ by **>= 5** (German Chocolate), and
- digits are **distinct within each row of the rectangle and each column of
  it** — a Latin condition, restricted to the rectangle's own cells.

That is all. Digits may repeat across different rows and columns; that is
exactly why `4 9 / 9 4` works as a 2x2.

Two things are *consequences*, not inputs:

- **No 5 in any group of area >= 2.** A 5 with a chocolate neighbour needs
  `|5 - d| >= 5`, so `d <= 0` or `d >= 10`. In a rectangle of area >= 2 every
  cell has at least one neighbour, so the 5 is squeezed out by the adjacency
  rule alone. **A 1x1 has no neighbour, so a lone chocolate 5 is legal** — and
  the 1x1 support below is all of 1..9 including 5, as it must be. Stated the
  way the component will want it: *no chocolate group of size >= 2 contains a
  5; every 5 on the grid is banana or a lone 1x1 chocolate cell.*
- **The low/high checkerboard.** Two digits from {1,2,3,4} differ by at most 3,
  as do two from {6,7,8,9}, so every chocolate adjacency pairs a low with a
  high and the parity classes are fixed. Not imposed; it emerges.

### Two layers, reported side by side

- **Layer L (Latin, region-agnostic)** — the constraints above and nothing
  else. No boxes. Reusable for any region layout, including a boxless or
  irregular-region variant, or the 6x6 variant.
- **Layer B (boxed)** — for each box offset `(ro, co)` of the rectangle's
  top-left cell mod 3, the subset of L in which no repeated digit has both its
  cells inside one sudoku box.

Distinctness against cells *outside* the rectangle is an embedding question,
not a catalogue question, and is in neither layer.

## Side bound

**No side exceeds 8.** A column of the rectangle holds `ceil(a/2)` cells of one
parity class. They lie in distinct grid rows but the same grid column, so they
are distinct, and they are all drawn from a 4-element set — {1,2,3,4} or
{6,7,8,9}. So `ceil(a/2) <= 4`, giving `a <= 8`; the same argument on rows gives
`b <= 8`. The bound depends on the 5 exclusion: the parity classes have four
members each *because* 5 is out, which holds for area >= 2 — and area 1 is the
only case where a side above 1 is impossible anyway.

**The enumeration is much tighter than that bound.** Latin-UNSAT shapes:

```
2x8  3x7  3x8  4x7  4x8  5x7  5x8  6x7  6x8  7x7  7x8  8x8
```

So in layer L the real limit is: a side of 8 needs the other side to be 1, a
side of 7 needs the other to be 1 or 2, and once both sides are >= 3 neither
exceeds 6.

## The catalogue

`L` is the layer-L filling count; `boxSAT offsets` are the `(ro, co)` classes
where layer B is non-empty. Exhaustive, nothing truncated.

| shape | area | L | boxSAT offsets |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1x1 | 1 | 9 | all 9 |
| 1x2 | 2 | 20 | all 9 |
| 1x3 | 3 | 40 | all 9 |
| 1x4 | 4 | 70 | all 9 |
| 1x5 | 5 | 72 | all 9 |
| 1x6 | 6 | 62 | all 9 |
| 1x7 | 7 | 16 | all 9 |
| 1x8 | 8 | 2 | all 6 that fit |
| 2x2 | 4 | 140 | all 9 |
| 2x3 | 6 | 428 | all 9 |
| 2x4 | 8 | 1148 | all 9 |
| 2x5 | 10 | 832 | all 9 |
| 2x6 | 12 | 396 | all 9 |
| 2x7 | 14 | 4 | **only ro=2** |
| 3x3 | 9 | 1520 | all but **(0,0)** |
| 3x4 | 12 | 5380 | only ro in {1,2} |
| 3x5 | 15 | 1600 | only ro in {1,2} |
| 3x6 | 18 | 408 | only ro in {1,2} |
| 4x4 | 16 | 26358 | **only (1,1)** |
| 4x5 | 20 | 3076 | **none** |
| 4x6 | 24 | 424 | **none** |
| 5x5 | 25 | 928 | **none** |
| 5x6 | 30 | 300 | **none** |
| 6x6 | 36 | 328 | **none** |
| 2x8, 3x7, 3x8, 4x7, 4x8, 5x7, 5x8, 6x7, 6x8, 7x7, 7x8, 8x8 | — | **0** | — |

Transposes `b x a` behave identically with the offsets swapped.

Two results worth pulling out:

- **Five shapes are Latin-legal but boxed-impossible: 4x5, 4x6, 5x5, 5x6, 6x6.**
  They cannot sit in a 9x9 sudoku at any offset. A boxless or irregular-region
  variant would admit them — which is precisely why layer L is worth keeping
  separately.
- **The largest chocolate rectangle a 9x9 sudoku can hold is 3x6 (18 cells)**,
  with 4x4 (16) and 2x7 (14) next. Subject to a legal shading existing, which
  is a separate question and a much harsher one.

## Layer L support matrices

Each entry is the set of digits that can occupy that cell.

```
1x1   123456789

1x4   12346789  123789    123789    12346789

3x3   12346789  123789    12346789
      123789    123789    123789
      12346789  123789    12346789
```

### The degree lemma

**Lemma.** Inside a chocolate rectangle, a cell's left and right neighbours
share its grid row, and its up and down neighbours share its grid column. Each
such pair must therefore be *distinct* partners of the cell's digit. A digit
with exactly one German partner can consequently never have two neighbours in
the same line. Partner sets are 1:{6,7,8,9}, 2:{7,8,9}, 3:{8,9}, **4:{9}**,
5:{}, **6:{1}**, 7:{1,2}, 8:{1,2,3}, 9:{1,2,3,4} — so the digits with a single
partner are exactly **4 and 6**, and each is confined to a rectangle **corner**,
where it has at most one horizontal and one vertical neighbour. Those two
neighbours carry equal digits (9 and 9 for a 4, 1 and 1 for a 6) in different
rows and different columns, so they collide unless the rectangle straddles a
box line.

**The support matrices reproduce it mechanically.** Every interior support
above is `123789` — no 4, no 6 — and every corner support is `12346789`. The
3x3 centre, degree 4, is `123789` for the same reason.

**Two confirming witnesses**, both verified grids from `CIRCLE-VALUES.md`:

- The circled **4** sits at r4c4 in a 2x2 at rows 3-4, cols 3-4, with **9 at
  r3c4 and 9 at r4c3** — its only two neighbours, equal, in different rows and
  columns, and the 2x2 straddles the horizontal band boundary so they land in
  different boxes.
- The circled **6** sits at r4c9, a corner of the 2x3 at rows 3-4, cols 7-9,
  with **1 at r3c9 and 1 at r4c8**.

**This doubles as the offset-handling self-check.** If layer B's support for
the digit 4 in a box-*aligned* 2x2 ever comes out non-empty, the offset
handling is wrong. It comes out `123789` — no 4 — at all four aligned offsets,
against `12346789` in layer L. The delta is neither empty nor total, which is
what a correct implementation looks like.

## The L-to-B delta

Where layer B differs from layer L is where the box constraint is doing work.
These three are the diagnostic cases.

**2x2 — this is the circled-4 story.** Box-aligned, the 4 vanishes.

```
offset (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)  -- box-aligned      count 40
    123789    123789
    123789    123789

offset (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)  -- straddling  count 140 (= all of L)
    12346789  12346789
    12346789  12346789
```

A 4 in a 2x2 needs a 9 on both neighbours; those two 9s sit in different rows
and different columns, so they collide only if the whole 2x2 is inside one box.
The moment the 2x2 straddles a box line in either direction, all four cells are
in different boxes and the box constraint does nothing at all — layer B equals
layer L. **A circled 4 in a 2x2 therefore requires a box-straddling 2x2**, and
that is now a table entry, not prose. The verified witness in
`CIRCLE-VALUES.md` has its 2x2 at rows 3-4, cols 3-4 — offset (2,2).

**2x3 — the same story for the circled 6, plus a side.**

```
offset (0,0), (1,0)   count 16    circle cells: none
    123789    1289      123789
    123789    1289      123789

offset (0,1), (1,1)   count 152   circle cells: the right-hand corners
    123789    123789    12346789
    123789    123789    12346789

offset (2,*)          count 428   circle cells: all four corners
    12346789  123789    12346789
    12346789  123789    12346789
```

**3x3 — the box-aligned 3x3 is impossible.** Offset (0,0) has layer B **empty**
against 1520 layer-L fillings. That is the mechanical form of the old hand
argument: a box-aligned 3x3 is a whole sudoku box, so it holds all nine digits
including the 5, which no multi-cell chocolate group may contain. Every other
offset is fine (40 at the once-straddling offsets, 552 at the twice-straddling
ones), and a 9 can sit in any of the nine cells.

## The circle query

Derived from the catalogue: for a shape of area `k`, can the digit `k` appear,
and where. This is the whole of `CIRCLE-VALUES.md`'s digit half, computed
exactly.

| area | shape | fillings containing the digit | where the digit may sit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1x1 | 9 of 9 | the cell |
| 4 | 1x4 | 12 of 70 | the two ends only |
| 4 | 2x2 | 14 of 140 | any cell — but only at a box-straddling offset |
| 5 | 1x5 | **0 of 72** | nowhere |
| 6 | 1x6 | 18 of 62 | the two ends only |
| 6 | 2x3 | — | the four corners only; which corners depends on the offset |
| 7 | 1x7 | **16 of 16** | any cell |
| 8 | 1x8 | 2 of 2 | positions 4 and 5 only |
| 8 | 2x4 | 1060 of 1148 | any cell |
| 9 | 3x3 | 1456 of 1520 | any cell, at any offset but (0,0) |

Two rows carry real weight:

- **Circle 5 is impossible, mechanically.** Area 5 has only one shape, 1x5, and
  not one of its 72 legal fillings contains a 5. That replaces the hand
  argument with an exhaustive check.
- **Circle 7 is free once the shape exists.** All 16 legal 1x7 fillings contain
  a 7, at every offset. So "can a circle read 7" and "does a 1x7 exist" are the
  same question — which is how `CIRCLE-VALUES.md` closes it.

## Why the support matrix is the artifact

Given a chocolate rectangle of known shape and box position, the support matrix
says which digits can sit in which cell — a sound candidate-elimination oracle,
computed once, offline, exhaustively. That is exactly the shape of deduction
the constraint component needs, and it is sound by construction: it never
removes a digit that some legal filling uses.

It does not solve the component's harder problem — the shading is existential,
so the component does not know which rectangle a cell belongs to. But once a
rectangle is known or hypothesised, this table is the answer, and it is
reusable at every later ticket on this map.

## One example per shape

Latin-legal but boxed-impossible, a layer-L filling instead.

## Method and verification

Plain depth-first search in row-major order, pruning on row distinctness,
column distinctness and the two adjacency differences as each cell is placed.
No CP-SAT anywhere near it. All 36 shapes finished exhaustively well inside a
minute; nothing was truncated, so every count above is exact and every support
matrix is complete.

Layer B is a filter over layer L: a filling survives offset `(ro, co)` iff no
digit repeats within a box, where the box of local cell `(i, j)` is
`((ro + i) // 3, (co + j) // 3)`. Offsets are restricted to those a side of
that length can actually take in a 9-wide grid — a side of 8 can only start at
column 1 or 2, so it has offsets 0 and 1.

**Verification, three independent ways.**

1. **Against a brute force.** The counts were cross-checked against a
   separately written enumerator that walks all `9^area` assignments and
   applies the rules directly, with no shared code: 1x1, 1x4, 1x6, 2x2 and 2x3
   in layer L, and 2x2 and 2x3 at four box offsets in layer B. Every count
   matched.
2. **Against real verified grids — the end-to-end check.** Take the five full
   9x9 grids that the from-scratch six-rule checker has passed (the
   `FEASIBILITY.md` witness and the four in `CIRCLE-VALUES.md`), decompose each
   into its chocolate components, and look every one of them up in the
   catalogue at its actual box offset. **All 93 rectangles are present, and
   every digit in every one of them lies in that offset's support matrix — zero
   mismatches.** A support matrix that had over-pruned would have shown up here
   as a legal digit missing from the table.
3. **Against results derived elsewhere.** The 1x8 row gives one filling up to
   reversal (`4 9 3 8 2 7 1 6`), matching `FEASIBILITY.md`; the 1x7 row gives
   16 fillings, i.e. 8 up to reversal, matching `CIRCLE-VALUES.md`; and the 3x3
   offset-(0,0) zero reproduces the box-aligned-3x3 argument.
