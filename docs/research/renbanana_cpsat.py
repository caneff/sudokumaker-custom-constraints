Rules (`renbanana/FEASIBILITY.md`): normal 9x9 sudoku; a free chocolate/banana
shading that is *not* part of the solution check; every maximal chocolate group
is a rectangle; every maximal banana group is not; orthogonally adjacent
chocolate digits differ by >= 5; every banana group's digits are distinct and
consecutive.

Pipeline — the two known-good stages, never a joint shading+digit search:

- **Stage 1, shadings only.** The chocolate-rectangle rule goes in exactly via
  the lemma "connected + no 2x2 window holding exactly three of the colour <=>
  every group is a rectangle". The banana size cap goes in *structurally* with
  component labels: each banana cell picks a label, adjacent banana cells share
  it, at most 9 cells carry one label. Cutting oversized components one at a
  time instead does not work — 2313 cuts found nothing in 150 s. The
  banana-non-rectangle rule is lazy: solve, find a rectangular banana
  component, forbid exactly that pattern, re-solve.
- **Stage 2/3, digits on a fixed shading.** Sudoku, the whisper on chocolate
  adjacencies, AllDifferent plus max - min == size - 1 per banana group. A
  shading with no digit fill is cut whole and stage 1 continues.

Objectives. `chocolate` (total chocolate cells) and `variety` (distinct
rectangle shapes) live in the shading layer, so stage 1 maximises them.
`circles` (circle-bearing groups weighted by the circle's value) and
`circleable` (count of groups that could carry a circle) depend on digits, so
they are maximised in stage 3 on each fixed shading. Weighting `circles` by
value is deliberate: a plain count optimises into nearly all 1s and 2s (#377).

Diversity is the load-bearing part. Random weights go on the shading *and* the
digits — weights on digits alone converge on one shading with permuted digits
(Zombo seeds 200 and 201 came out identical). A new candidate must differ from
every earlier grid in the batch on *either* Hamming distance >= 12 on the
shading *or* its rectangle-shape multiset. Either-or: requiring both
over-filters and starves the pool.

Nothing enters the pool unverified — every candidate is re-checked from scratch
by `renbanana_verify.py`, written from the rules rather than from this encoding.
